## Priority Optimization Recommendations

### ? HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Implementation)

#### 1. Implement Parallel Aggregation Pipeline
**Issue:** Throughput degrades significantly with scale (371 vs 36,953 violations/sec)
**Solution:** Multi-threaded aggregation with work-stealing queue
```python
# Recommended approach
class ParallelAggregationPipeline:
    def __init__(self, worker_threads=4):
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=worker_threads)
        self.work_queue = WorkStealingQueue()
    
    async def aggregate_parallel(self, detector_results: List[Dict]):
        # Partition work by detector type
        partitions = self.partition_by_detector(detector_results)
        
        # Process partitions in parallel
        futures = [
            self.thread_pool.submit(self._process_partition, partition)
            for partition in partitions
        ]
        
        # Combine results
        return await self._combine_parallel_results(futures)
```

**Expected Impact:** 3-5x throughput improvement for large datasets  
**Implementation Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)  

#### 2. Adaptive Batching for Latency Smoothing
**Issue:** P99 latency spikes from 1.37ms to 13,532ms  
**Solution:** Dynamic batch sizing based on processing velocity
```python
class AdaptiveBatchProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_latency_ms = 50.0
        self.min_batch_size = 10
        self.max_batch_size = 100
        
    def calculate_optimal_batch_size(self, recent_latencies: List[float]) -> int:
        avg_latency = statistics.mean(recent_latencies)
        
        if avg_latency > self.target_latency_ms:
            # Reduce batch size to decrease latency
            return max(self.min_batch_size, self.current_batch_size // 2)
        else:
            # Increase batch size for better throughput
            return min(self.max_batch_size, self.current_batch_size + 5)
```

**Expected Impact:** 60-80% reduction in P99 latency spikes  
**Implementation Effort:** Low (1 day)

### ? MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

#### 3. Correlation Engine Performance Consistency
**Issue:** -31% consistency score with 3.8ms standard deviation  
**Solution:** Implement correlation result caching and algorithm optimization
```python
class CachedCorrelationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.correlation_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=1000)
        self.similarity_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=5000)
    
    def calculate_correlation_with_cache(self, violation_a, violation_b):
        cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(violation_a, violation_b)
        
        if cache_key in self.correlation_cache:
            return self.correlation_cache[cache_key]
        
        correlation = self._calculate_correlation_optimized(violation_a, violation_b)
        self.correlation_cache[cache_key] = correlation
        return correlation
```

**Expected Impact:** 50-70% improvement in processing consistency  
**Implementation Effort:** Medium (2 days)

#### 4. Enhanced Streaming Buffer Management  
**Issue:** Buffer utilization fixed at 75% - opportunity for optimization
**Solution:** Dynamic buffer sizing with backpressure handling
```python
class DynamicStreamBuffer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = deque()
        self.max_size = 1000
        self.target_utilization = 0.8
        
    def add_with_backpressure(self, item):
        current_utilization = len(self.buffer) / self.max_size
        
        if current_utilization > 0.95:
            # Apply backpressure
            await asyncio.sleep(0.001 * current_utilization)
        
        self.buffer.append(item)
        
        # Dynamic resizing
        if current_utilization < 0.3:
            self.max_size = max(500, self.max_size - 100)
        elif current_utilization > 0.9:
            self.max_size = min(5000, self.max_size + 200)
```

**Expected Impact:** 15-25% improvement in streaming efficiency  
**Implementation Effort:** Medium (1-2 days)

### ? LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancement)

#### 5. Memory Pressure Monitoring and GC Optimization
**Issue:** Memory grows from 0.008MB to 195MB for large datasets
**Solution:** Incremental garbage collection and memory pressure detection
```python
class MemoryPressureManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gc_threshold_mb = 100.0
        self.pressure_threshold = 0.8
    
    def monitor_and_optimize(self):
        current_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
        
        if current_memory > self.gc_threshold_mb:
            gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
            
        memory_pressure = current_memory / psutil.virtual_memory().total
        if memory_pressure > self.pressure_threshold:
            self._trigger_memory_optimization()
```

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% memory efficiency improvement  
**Implementation Effort:** Low (1 day)
