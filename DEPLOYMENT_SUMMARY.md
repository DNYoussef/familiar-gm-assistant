## [TARGET] Critical Gap Resolution

### PRIMARY GAP: Rule 2 - Function Size Compliance
- **Current**: 85% -> **Target**: 95%
- **Gap**: 10% compliance improvement needed
- **Strategy**: Extract Method refactoring with Command Pattern
- **Violations Found**: 13 functions >60 LOC
- **Solution**: Surgical decomposition with bounded operations (<=25 LOC, <=2 files)

**Large Functions Identified**:
- `loadConnascenceSystem`: 149 LOC -> requires decomposition
- `__init__`: 83 LOC -> requires refactoring
- `_run_tree_sitter_nasa_analysis`: 69 LOC -> extract methods needed
- `_run_dedicated_nasa_analysis`: 65 LOC -> command pattern implementation
- `_run_ast_optimizer_analysis`: 62 LOC -> bounded surgical edits

### SECONDARY GAP: Rule 4 - Bounded Loop Operations
- **Current**: 82% -> **Target**: 92%
- **Gap**: 10% compliance improvement needed  
- **Strategy**: BoundedASTWalker implementation
- **Solution**: Stack-based iteration with explicit resource bounds
- **Implementation**: Max depth=20, max nodes=5000, timeout protection

### MAJOR GAP: Rule 5 - Defensive Assertions
- **Current**: 75% -> **Target**: 90%
- **Gap**: 15% compliance improvement needed
- **Strategy**: Systematic assertion injection with icontract framework
- **Opportunities**: 30 assertions needed across 23 functions
- **Coverage Improvement**: 100% coverage enhancement potential

## [U+1F6E0][U+FE0F] Systematic Improvement Implementation

### Phase 1: Function Decomposition (1-2 weeks)
```python
# Extract Method + Command Pattern Implementation
class FunctionDecompositionCommand:
    def execute_bounded_refactoring(self, function_target):
        # NASA Rule 4 compliant: <=25 LOC, <=2 files per operation
        return self.extract_method_with_bounds(function_target)
```

**Operations**: 8 bounded surgical edits  
**Expected Improvement**: +2% compliance  
**Safety**: Comprehensive testing + rollback capability  

### Phase 2: Bounded AST Traversal (1-2 weeks)  
```python
class BoundedASTWalker:
    def walk_bounded(self, tree: ast.AST) -> Iterator[ast.AST]:
        # NASA Rule 4: Explicit bounds enforcement
        stack = deque([(tree, 0)])  # Stack-based, not recursive
        while stack and self.nodes_processed < MAX_NODES:
            # Bounded operations with resource monitoring
```

**Operations**: 6 module modifications  
**Expected Improvement**: +2% compliance  
**Safety**: Resource bounds + performance monitoring  

### Phase 3: Assertion Injection (2-3 weeks)
```python
# icontract Integration Framework
@require(lambda param: param is not None, "NASA Rule 5 compliance")
@ensure(lambda result: result is not None, "Return value validation")  
@bounded_operation(max_iterations=1000)
def nasa_compliant_function(param):
    # Systematic defensive programming
```

**Operations**: 12 assertion injection operations  
**Expected Improvement**: +3% compliance  
**Safety**: Systematic validation + performance impact assessment
