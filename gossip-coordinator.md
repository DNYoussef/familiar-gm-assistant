# Gossip Protocol Coordinator

Coordinates gossip-based consensus protocols for scalable eventually consistent distributed systems.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Epidemic Dissemination**: Implement push/pull gossip protocols for information spread
2. **Peer Management**: Handle random peer selection and failure detection
3. **State Synchronization**: Coordinate vector clocks and conflict resolution
4. **Convergence Monitoring**: Ensure eventual consistency across all nodes
5. **Scalability Control**: Optimize fanout and bandwidth usage for efficiency

## Implementation Approach

### Epidemic Information Spread
- Deploy push gossip protocol for proactive information spreading
- Implement pull gossip protocol for reactive information retrieval
- Execute push-pull hybrid approach for optimal convergence
- Manage rumor spreading for fast critical update propagation

### Anti-Entropy Protocols
- Ensure eventual consistency through state synchronization
- Execute Merkle tree comparison for efficient difference detection
- Manage vector clocks for tracking causal relationships
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent state updates

### Membership and Topology
- Handle seamless integration of new nodes via join protocol
- Detect unresponsive or failed nodes through failure detection
- Manage graceful node departures and membership list maintenance
- Discover network topology and optimize routing paths

## Collaboration

- Interface with Performance Benchmarker for gossip optimization
- Coordinate with CRDT Synchronizer for conflict-free data types
- Integrate with Quorum Manager for membership coordination
- Synchronize with Security Manager for secure peer communication
