# Unified Memory Architecture - SPEK Template

## Executive Summary

The Unified Memory Architecture eliminates the duplication between Claude Flow memory and Memory MCP systems by implementing an intelligent router that leverages the strengths of both while creating a single, coherent memory interface for all SPEK agents.

| `swarm/*` | Claude Flow | Swarm coordination expertise | `swarm/hierarchy/task-123` |
| `session/*` | Claude Flow | Session state management | `session/after-edit/state` |
| `coordination/*` | Claude Flow | Agent coordination | `coordination/hive/agents` |
| `analysis/*` | Memory MCP | Analysis pattern expertise | `analysis/connascence/patterns` |

## [TOOL] Usage Patterns

### Basic Operations
```bash
# Store with intelligent routing (routes to Memory MCP)
/memory:unified --store --namespace=analysis/connascence --key=patterns --value='{"CoM": 23, "CoP": 45}'

# Retrieve with cross-system search (checks both systems)
/memory:unified --retrieve --namespace=patterns --key=architectural-best-practices

# Search across both systems
/memory:unified --search --query="performance optimization" --namespace=intelligence
```

### Agent Coordination
```bash
# Store coordination data (routes to Claude Flow)
/memory:unified --store --namespace=coordination/swarm --key=task-assignments --value='{"agents": 12, "completed": 8}'

# Store shared intelligence (bridge unified - stored in both systems)
/memory:unified --store --namespace=intelligence/patterns --key=success-factors --value='{"coupling_threshold": 0.5}'
```

### Cross-System Synchronization
```bash
# Manual synchronization (automatic sync every 5 minutes)
/memory:unified --sync --performance-stats

# Router status and configuration
/memory:unified --router-config --performance-stats
```

## [U+1F9E9] Integration with Existing Systems

### Command Integration Pattern
All enhanced commands now use the unified memory bridge:

```bash
# In any enhanced command
source scripts/memory_bridge.sh

# Store analysis results with intelligent routing
unified_memory_store "analysis/qa" "latest_run" "$qa_results" '{"session": "'$SESSION_ID'"}'

# Retrieve historical patterns for enhanced analysis
historical_data=$(unified_memory_retrieve "intelligence/patterns" "qa_success" 2>/dev/null || echo '{}')

# Synchronize for cross-agent availability
sync_memory_systems
```

### Workflow Integration Pattern
Workflows initialize unified memory and leverage cross-session intelligence:

```yaml
- id: enhanced_analysis
  run: |
    # Initialize unified memory coordination
    source scripts/memory_bridge.sh
    initialize_memory_router
    
    # Retrieve historical context for smarter analysis
    historical_context=$(scripts/memory_bridge.sh retrieve "intelligence/patterns" "success_patterns")
    
    # Run analysis with unified memory context
    /qa:run --architecture --historical-context "$historical_context"
    
    # Store results for future agents
    scripts/memory_bridge.sh store "analysis/qa" "run_$(date +%s)" "$(cat results.json)"
    
    # Synchronize across systems
    scripts/memory_bridge.sh sync
```

3. **Intelligence Sharing**: Target >80% pattern reuse across agents
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Target <200MB total memory usage
5. **Agent Coordination**: Target <10s average handoff time

## [SHIELD] Security & Reliability

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All stored data encrypted with AES-256
- **Access Control**: Namespace-based permissions and agent authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all memory operations
- **Data Retention**: Configurable TTL with automatic cleanup

### Reliability Features
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working if one memory system fails
- **Automatic Failover**: Intelligent routing to available systems
- **Data Validation**: Integrity checks with automatic corruption recovery
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery

## [U+1F393] Best Practices

### Memory Organization
1. **Use Descriptive Namespaces**: `analysis/connascence/coupling_patterns` instead of `data/123`
2. **Include Metadata**: Always provide context about data type, session, and purpose
3. **Set Appropriate TTL**: Don't store temporary data indefinitely
4. **Namespace by Purpose**: Separate coordination, analysis, and intelligence data
5. **Cross-Agent Sharing**: Use `intelligence/*` namespace for data meant to be shared

### Performance Optimization
1. **Batch Operations**: Group related memory operations together
2. **Use Caching**: Leverage automatic caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Monitor Performance**: Regular performance analysis and optimization
4. **Clean Up Regularly**: Remove obsolete data to maintain performance
5. **Sync Strategically**: Manual sync only when immediate availability is critical
