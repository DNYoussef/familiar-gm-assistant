## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from enterprise_detector_pool import create_enterprise_pool

# Create optimized detector pool
with create_enterprise_pool() as pool:
    # Register detectors
    pool.register_detector("security_scanner", security_detector_func)
    pool.register_detector("performance_analyzer", perf_detector_func)

    # Execute single detector
    result = pool.execute_detector("security_scanner", code_path="/src")

    # Execute multiple detectors in parallel
    configs = [
        ("security_scanner", ("/src",), {}),
        ("performance_analyzer", ("/src",), {})
    ]
    results = pool.execute_parallel(configs)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from enterprise_detector_pool import EnterpriseDetectorPool
from defense_compliance_monitor import RealTimeComplianceMonitor

# Create enterprise pool with custom configuration
pool = EnterpriseDetectorPool(
    max_workers=16,
    cache_size=10000,
    cache_ttl=3600,
    enable_profiling=True,
    audit_mode=True
)

# Enable compliance monitoring
compliance_monitor = RealTimeComplianceMonitor()
compliance_monitor.start_monitoring(pool)

# Register detectors with priorities and complexity scores
pool.register_detector(
    name="critical_security_scan",
    detector_func=security_scanner,
    priority=10,  # High priority
    complexity_score=3.0  # High complexity
)

# Execute with adaptive optimization
results = pool.execute_adaptive(
    detector_configs=configs,
    target_overhead=0.01  # 1% overhead target
)
```
