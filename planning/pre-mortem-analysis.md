# Pre-Mortem Risk Analysis: Familiar Project

## Failure Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: "The Project Never Ships"
**Probability**: Medium-High | **Impact**: Critical

#### Root Causes
1. **Scope Creep**: Adding D&D 5e, voice features, campaign management
2. **Technical Complexity**: Hybrid RAG proves too complex for timeline
3. **API Dependencies**: Archives of Nethys access becomes restricted
4. **Performance Issues**: Cannot achieve <2 second response time

#### Early Warning Signs
- Research phase extending beyond 2 weeks
- Architecture discussions becoming circular
- No working prototype after 4 weeks
- Performance benchmarks consistently failing

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Strict MVP Definition**: Raven familiar + basic rules only
- **Time-boxed Research**: 1 week research maximum per component
- **Performance-First Architecture**: Benchmark early and often
- **Fallback Plans**: Local SRD cache, simplified RAG

### Scenario 2: "The Performance is Unacceptable"
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

#### Root Causes
1. **RAG Complexity**: Hybrid system too slow for real-time gameplay
2. **API Latency**: External API calls causing delays
3. **Foundry Integration**: Canvas performance impact
4. **Memory Usage**: Large knowledge graphs consuming resources

#### Early Warning Signs
- Initial queries taking >5 seconds
- Foundry lag when familiar is active
- High memory usage reports
- Complex graph queries timing out

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Aggressive Caching**: Pre-cache 90% of common queries
- **Background Processing**: Async operations where possible
- **Simplified Models**: Start with vector-only RAG
- **Local Processing**: Edge computing for critical path

### Scenario 3: "Legal Issues Kill the Project"
**Probability**: Low-Medium | **Impact**: Critical

#### Root Causes
1. **Paizo Policy Violation**: Misunderstanding community use terms
2. **Archives Access**: Unauthorized scraping discovered
3. **Commercial Use**: Monetization conflicts with licenses
4. **Content Attribution**: Inadequate source citation

#### Early Warning Signs
- Unclear responses from Paizo legal
- Archives of Nethys blocking access
- Community concerns about licensing
- Missing attribution requirements

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Legal Review First**: Before any development
- **Official Partnerships**: Contact Paizo early
- **Conservative Compliance**: Over-comply with policies
- **Community Engagement**: Transparent development process

### Scenario 4: "The AI Quality is Poor"
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

#### Root Causes
1. **Hallucination Issues**: LLM creates incorrect rules
2. **Context Problems**: RAG retrieving irrelevant information
3. **Art Quality**: Generated images look unprofessional
4. **Inconsistency**: Different answers to same questions

#### Early Warning Signs
- Accuracy testing below 90%
- User reports of wrong rules
- Generated art requires extensive editing
- Inconsistent response quality

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Extensive Testing**: Rule validation against official sources
- **Human Review**: Expert validation of AI responses
- **Quality Gates**: Accuracy thresholds before features ship
- **Feedback Loops**: User correction mechanisms

### Scenario 5: "Nobody Wants to Use It"
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

#### Root Causes
1. **Poor UX**: Raven familiar is intrusive or confusing
2. **Limited Value**: Doesn't solve real GM problems
3. **Competition**: Existing tools serve the need better
4. **Technical Barriers**: Too difficult to install/configure

#### Early Warning Signs
- Low beta tester engagement
- Negative feedback on UI/UX
- Users preferring manual rule lookup
- High abandonment rate

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **User Research**: Interview GMs early and often
- **Iterative Design**: Rapid prototyping and testing
- **Real Problem Focus**: Solve actual pain points
- **Friction Reduction**: Minimize setup complexity

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

### Critical Path Risks (Address First)
1. **Legal Compliance**: Complete legal review within 1 week
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Prove performance targets in 2 weeks
3. **API Access**: Secure reliable data access within 1 week

### High-Impact Risks (Address Second)
1. **Quality Standards**: Implement testing framework early
2. **User Experience**: Begin user research immediately
3. **Foundry Integration**: Create integration prototype early

### Monitoring Dashboard

#### Green (Good)
- Legal clearance obtained
- Performance targets met in testing
- User feedback positive
- Technical milestones on schedule

#### Yellow (Caution)
- Performance within 50% of targets
- Minor legal concerns identified
- Mixed user feedback
- Some technical delays

#### Red (Critical)
- Performance targets missed by >50%
- Legal blockers identified
- Negative user feedback
- Major technical failures

## Contingency Plans

### Plan A: Full Featured Familiar
- Hybrid RAG system
- AI art generation
- Complete Pathfinder integration

### Plan B: Simplified Rules Assistant
- Vector-only RAG
- Text responses only
- Core rules subset

### Plan C: Foundry Module Framework
- Basic familiar interface
- Manual rule entry
- Community-driven content

### Plan D: Research Publication
- Document findings
- Open source components
- Academic contribution

## Success Probability Assessment

**Current Assessment**: 65% chance of successful MVP delivery

**Factors Increasing Success**:
- Strong technical research foundation
- Clear scope definition
- Risk-aware planning
- Iterative development approach

**Factors Decreasing Success**:
- Technical complexity of hybrid RAG
- Legal uncertainty
- Performance requirements
- Limited timeline

**Recommended Confidence Threshold**: 80% for full development commitment

## Next Steps for Risk Reduction
1. **Week 1**: Complete legal review and API access verification
2. **Week 2**: Build performance prototype and benchmark
3. **Week 3**: User research and UX validation
4. **Week 4**: Technical architecture finalization

This pre-mortem analysis should be revisited weekly and updated based on new information and development progress.
