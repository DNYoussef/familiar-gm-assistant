**Current Mitigation Status:** 2% (Load testing, auto-scaling, CDN optimization)

### Category 4: Business Model Failures (15% probability weight)

#### Failure Mode 4.1: Subscription Model Rejection
**Nightmare Scenario:** Users expect free service forever. Attempts to monetize result in 95% user churn and negative community sentiment.

**Warning Signs We Missed:**
- No clear value proposition for paid tiers
- Free tier too generous
- Pricing research insufficient
- No grandfathering strategy

**Impact Assessment:**
- Revenue model collapse
- Development funding depleted
- Forced shutdown within 6 months
- Developer reputation damage

**Likelihood Without Mitigation:** 8%
**Current Mitigation Status:** 1% (Pricing research, value tier design)
