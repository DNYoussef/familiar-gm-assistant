# Fallback Strategies - Familiar VTT Assistant
## Comprehensive Contingency Planning

### Strategy Overview
Every critical component has multiple fallback layers to ensure graceful degradation rather than complete failure.

## Component Fallback Strategies

### 1. Foundry VTT Integration Failures

#### Primary Failure: Module Installation Issues
**Fallback Level 1: Manual Installation**
- Provide zip file download with manual installation instructions
- Include troubleshooting guide for common installation problems
- Automated compatibility checker script

**Fallback Level 2: Bookmarklet Version**
- JavaScript bookmarklet that injects Familiar functionality
- Reduced feature set but core chat functionality preserved
- No Foundry dependency, works with any web-based VTT

**Fallback Level 3: Standalone Web Application**
- Independent web app at familiar.gamemaster.tools
- Discord/Slack integration for group coordination
- Export functionality to import data into VTT later

#### Secondary Failure: Hook System Incompatibility
**Detection:** Automated hook testing on startup
**Fallback:** Polling-based state detection
**Impact:** 200ms delay vs 50ms real-time updates
**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Hook-based (preferred)
Hooks.on('updateActor', handleActorUpdate);

// Polling fallback
setInterval(() => {
  checkForActorChanges();
}, 200);
```

### 2. AI Service Failures

#### Primary Failure: OpenAI API Unavailable
**Fallback Level 1: Anthropic Claude**
- Automatic provider switching within 5 seconds
- Conversation context preserved across providers
- 95% feature parity maintained

**Fallback Level 2: Local LLM (Ollama)**
- Pre-downloaded Llama 2 7B model
- Runs locally on user's machine
- Reduced capability but core rules assistance available

**Fallback Level 3: Static Rule Database**
- Pre-indexed Pathfinder 2e rules searchable database
- Keyword matching with relevance scoring
- No conversational AI but rapid rule lookup

#### API Rate Limiting
**Detection:** HTTP 429 responses
**Fallback:** Queue system with estimated wait times
**User Communication:** "High usage detected, your query is #3 in queue (est. 45 seconds)"

### 3. Pathfinder 2e RAG System Failures

#### Vector Database Unavailable
**Fallback Level 1: Cached Results**
- 24-hour local cache of common queries
- 80% hit rate for frequently asked rules
- Transparent fallback with staleness indicator

**Fallback Level 2: Traditional Text Search**
- Elasticsearch fallback for text-based queries
- Reduced accuracy (85% vs 95%) but faster responses
- Full-text search across rule documents

**Fallback Level 3: Static JSON Lookup**
- Pre-compiled rule lookup tables
- Exact match only, no semantic understanding
- Covers 90% of common rule queries

### 4. Monster Generation Failures

#### CR Calculation Service Down
**Fallback Level 1: Client-Side Calculation**
- JavaScript implementation of CR algorithm
- Full accuracy maintained
- Slight performance impact (2s vs 1s generation)

**Fallback Level 2: Pre-Generated Templates**
- 500+ pre-calculated monster stat blocks
- Organized by CR and environment
- Randomization through template variation

**Fallback Level 3: Manual Generation Guide**
- Step-by-step CR calculation worksheet
- Interactive form with validation
- Educational value for understanding monster design

### 5. AI Art Generation Failures

#### DALL-E/FLUX API Unavailable
**Fallback Level 1: Alternative Providers**
- Midjourney API (when available)
- Stable Diffusion local generation
- Style transfer from existing art assets

**Fallback Level 2: Asset Library**
- 1000+ pre-generated creature portraits
- Categorized by creature type and CR
- Customizable through color/effect overlays

**Fallback Level 3: Community Art Integration**
- Curated open-source art collections
- Community submission system with moderation
- Attribution and licensing management

#### Nana Banana Editing Service Down
**Fallback Level 1: Basic Filters**
- Client-side image processing (Canvas API)
- Color adjustment, cropping, basic effects
- 70% of editing functionality preserved

**Fallback Level 2: Manual Download**
- Direct image download with editing instructions
- Integration guides for GIMP/Photoshop
- Template overlays for common modifications

### 6. Network and Infrastructure Failures

#### CDN Unavailable
**Fallback Level 1: Multiple CDN Providers**
- Automatic failover between Cloudflare and AWS CloudFront
- Geographic routing optimization
- 99.9% availability through redundancy

**Fallback Level 2: Direct Server Delivery**
- Assets served directly from origin servers
- Reduced performance but maintained functionality
- Automatic scaling during high load

#### Database Connection Loss
**Fallback Level 1: Read Replicas**
- Automatic failover to read-only replicas
- Reduced functionality (no saves) but queries work
- Queue writes for replay on recovery

**Fallback Level 2: Local Storage**
- Client-side caching using IndexedDB
- Offline functionality for cached data
- Sync on reconnection

## Monitoring and Detection Systems

### Health Check Endpoints
```
/health/foundry     - VTT integration status
/health/ai          - AI service availability
/health/rag         - RAG system performance
/health/monsters    - Generation service status
/health/art         - Art pipeline health
/health/db          - Database connectivity
```

### Automated Fallback Triggers
```javascript
const fallbackTriggers = {
  responseTime: {
    warning: 2000,    // 2 seconds
    critical: 5000,   // 5 seconds
    action: 'enableFallback'
  },
  errorRate: {
    warning: 0.01,    // 1%
    critical: 0.05,   // 5%
    action: 'switchProvider'
  },
  availability: {
    warning: 0.995,   // 99.5%
    critical: 0.99,   // 99%
    action: 'activateBackup'
  }
};
```

### User Communication Strategy

#### Graceful Degradation Messages
- "Using alternative AI provider for faster response..."
- "Loading from cache while we update the database..."
- "Generating using local engine, this may take a moment..."

#### Transparency Indicators
- Service status page: status.familiar.gamemaster.tools
- In-app status indicators with explanation
- Estimated restoration times when known

## Recovery Procedures

### Automatic Recovery
```javascript
const recoveryProcedures = {
  serviceRestart: {
    trigger: 'healthCheckFailure',
    maxAttempts: 3,
    backoffMultiplier: 2,
    timeoutSeconds: 30
  },
  databaseReconnect: {
    trigger: 'connectionLost',
    retryInterval: 5000,
    exponentialBackoff: true,
    maxRetries: 10
  },
  cacheInvalidation: {
    trigger: 'staleData',
    strategy: 'lazy',
    maxAge: 3600
  }
};
```

### Manual Intervention Triggers
- 3+ consecutive automatic recovery failures
- Error rate >10% for 5+ minutes
- User reports indicating systematic issues
- Security incident detection

## Testing Strategies

### Failure Simulation
```bash
# Simulate API failures
curl -X POST /admin/simulate-failure \
  -d '{"service": "openai", "duration": 300}'

# Test network partitions
docker network disconnect bridge familiar-ai-service

# Simulate high load
hey -n 10000 -c 100 http://familiar.gamemaster.tools/api/chat
```

### Chaos Engineering
