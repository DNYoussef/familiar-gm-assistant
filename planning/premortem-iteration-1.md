## **NEW FAILURE MODES IDENTIFIED**

### 1. API Cascade Failure Risk
**Probability**: 8% | **Impact**: Critical | **NEW RISK**

#### Specific Failure Pattern
- Archives of Nethys API changes without notice
- Backup community APIs follow similar deprecation schedule
- Gemini API rate limits triggered during peak usage
- OpenAI DALL-E quota exhausted during high-demand periods

#### Technical Indicators
```javascript
// Early warning system needed
const apiHealthCheck = {
  nethysAPI: { status: 'healthy', lastCheck: Date.now(), failureCount: 0 },
  geminiAPI: { status: 'healthy', rateLimit: 0.8, quotaUsed: 0.6 },
  dalleAPI: { status: 'healthy', quotaRemaining: 1000 }
};
```

#### **Concrete Mitigation** (Reduces failure probability by 3%)
1. **Multi-API Redundancy**: Implement 3 data sources minimum
   - Primary: Archives of Nethys
   - Secondary: Community Pathfinder API
   - Tertiary: Local SRD cache (50MB core rules)
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Auto-failover within 500ms
3. **Quota Management**: Pre-allocate 80% of monthly API limits
4. **Health Monitoring**: Real-time API status dashboard

### 2. Foundry Version Compatibility Cascade
**Probability**: 6% | **Impact**: High | **AMPLIFIED RISK**

#### Specific Failure Pattern
- Foundry v12 releases with breaking HUD API changes
- Canvas rendering system overhaul impacts overlay positioning
- Hook system modifications break familiar initialization
- WebGL context changes affect performance calculations

#### **Concrete Mitigation** (Reduces failure probability by 2%)
1. **Version Testing Matrix**: Automated testing across Foundry v11, v11.3, v12-dev
2. **API Abstraction Layer**: Isolate Foundry-specific code
3. **Compatibility Monitoring**: Weekly API change detection
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to text-only mode if canvas fails

### 3. RAG Quality Degradation Under Load
**Probability**: 4% | **Impact**: Medium | **NEW RISK**

#### Specific Failure Pattern
- Vector similarity scores degrade with database size
- Graph traversal becomes exponentially slower
- Memory usage spikes cause garbage collection pauses
- Cache hit rates drop below 70%

#### **Concrete Mitigation** (Reduces failure probability by 1.5%)
1. **Performance Budgets**:
   - Vector search: <200ms
   - Graph queries: <500ms
   - Memory usage: <100MB
2. **Intelligent Pruning**: Remove least-accessed embeddings monthly
3. **Progressive Loading**: Essential rules first, advanced features later
4. **Load Testing**: Simulate 100 concurrent queries

## **ENHANCED TECHNICAL RISK ANALYSIS**

### Performance Engineering Failure Modes

#### **Cache Invalidation Cascade** (2% failure probability)
```javascript
// Risk: Cache becomes stale, accuracy drops
const cacheStrategy = {
  rulesCache: { ttl: '24h', accuracy: '>98%' },
  artCache: { ttl: '7d', compression: 'webp' },
  vectorCache: { ttl: '1h', maxSize: '50MB' }
};
```

**Mitigation**: Smart cache versioning with content-addressed storage

#### **Memory Leak in Vector Operations** (1.5% failure probability)
```javascript
// Risk: Long-running sessions consume increasing memory
const memoryMonitoring = {
  embeddings: { maxSize: '100MB', gcTrigger: '80MB' },
  vectorStore: { compression: true, cleanup: 'hourly' }
};
```

**Mitigation**: Aggressive garbage collection and embedding pool management

### Legal and Compliance Risk Amplification

#### **Community Use Policy Interpretation Gap** (3% failure probability)
- **Specific Risk**: Paizo's Community Use Policy allows "excerpts" but not "substantial portions"
- **Gray Area**: RAG system stores entire rule text for embedding
- **Enforcement Risk**: Automated content detection flags the module

**Enhanced Mitigation**:
1. **Legal Opinion**: Retain gaming industry attorney ($2,000 investment)
2. **Paizo Partnership Track**: Submit formal partnership proposal
3. **Content Abstraction**: Store semantic embeddings, not raw text
4. **Attribution Engine**: Dynamic source citation for every response

---

## **USER ADOPTION FAILURE MODES**

### 1. GM Workflow Disruption (4% failure probability)
**Pattern**: Familiar interface breaks existing GM muscle memory
- Clicking familiar accidentally during combat
- Chat responses interrupt player dialogue
- Art generation delays break game flow

**Mitigation**:
- **Invisible Mode**: Familiar fades when players are speaking
- **Context Awareness**: Detect combat phase, reduce interruptions
- **Undo Function**: One-click to dismiss responses

### 2. Learning Curve Cliff (3% failure probability)
**Pattern**: Feature complexity overwhelms casual GMs
- RAG query syntax too complex
- Art generation requires prompt engineering
- Troubleshooting requires technical knowledge

**Mitigation**:
- **Natural Language Only**: No query syntax required
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured art styles and prompts
- **Auto-Diagnosis**: Self-healing configuration system

---

## **INTEGRATION FAILURE MODES**

### Module Ecosystem Conflicts (2.5% failure probability)
```javascript
// Risk: Popular modules conflict with familiar
const conflictRisks = [
  'Token Action HUD', // Canvas overlay conflicts
  'Monk\'s Enhanced Journal', // Journal API conflicts
  'Dice So Nice', // Performance during dice rolls
  'Perfect Vision' // Lighting calculations affect familiar rendering
];
```

**Mitigation**:
- **Compatibility Testing**: Test with top 20 Foundry modules
- **API Cooperation**: Coordinate with major module developers
- **Graceful Conflicts**: Detect conflicts, offer disable options

### PF2e System Updates Breaking RAG (2% failure probability)
- **Risk**: Pathfinder 2e Foundry system updates change data structures
- **Impact**: Rules engine returns incorrect information
- **Detection**: Automated system version monitoring

**Mitigation**:
- **System Version Hooks**: Auto-adapt to PF2e system changes
- **Data Format Abstraction**: Isolate system-specific code
- **Regression Testing**: Validate rules accuracy after updates

## **BUSINESS MODEL FAILURE MODES**

### Unsustainable API Costs (1.5% failure probability)
```javascript
// Cost explosion scenarios
const costRisks = {
  viralAdoption: {
    users: 10000,
    queriesPerUser: 50,
    monthlyCost: '$15,000'
  },
  artGeneration: {
    imagesPerSession: 20,
    costPerImage: '$0.04',
    riskMultiplier: 'x50 on viral content'
  }
};
```

**Mitigation**:
- **Freemium Model**: 10 queries/day free, unlimited for $5/month
