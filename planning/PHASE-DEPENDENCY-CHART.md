**PROJECT**: Raven Familiar GM Assistant for Foundry VTT  
**ANALYSIS DATE**: 2025-09-18  
**EXECUTION MODEL**: Queen-Princess-Drone Hierarchical

## DEPENDENCY CLASSIFICATION

### SEQUENTIAL PHASES (Critical Path Dependencies)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[START] --> B[Phase 2: Core Architecture]
    B --> C[Phase 4: Integration]
    C --> D[Phase 6: Final Validation]
    D --> E[END]
    
    style B fill:#ff9999
    style C fill:#ff9999
    style D fill:#ff9999
```

**CRITICAL SEQUENTIAL DEPENDENCIES:**
1. **Phase 2: Core Architecture** - MUST complete before any implementation
2. **Phase 4: Integration** - MUST wait for all Group B completions
3. **Phase 6: Final Validation** - MUST be last phase

### MANDATORY SEQUENCE
```bash
# STEP 1: Execute Group A (Parallel)
./execute-parallel-group.sh A --princesses infrastructure,research,security

# STEP 2: Wait for Group A completion, then execute Phase 2 (Sequential)

## EXECUTION MONITORING

### Real-Time Dependency Tracking
```bash
# Monitor parallel group status
watch -n 30 './check-parallel-status.sh A'

# Validate sequential phase readiness
./validate-dependency-completion.sh phase-2

# Track critical path progress
./monitor-critical-path.sh --alert-on-delays
```

### Success Criteria
```yaml
execution_success:
  parallel_efficiency: ">80% resource utilization"
  dependency_violations: "0 blocking failures"
