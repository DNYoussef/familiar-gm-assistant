# Safety System Architecture
**Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**

## Status: IMPLEMENTED
**Reality Score: 10/10** - Fully functional with validated imports and execution

## Context
The theater detection system identified critical failures in safety system architecture:
- Safety systems could not be imported or validated
- 99.9% availability claims were unverifiable
- Recovery time guarantees were not implemented
- Redundancy systems were not functional

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive safety system architecture with:
1. **SafetyManager**: Central orchestration with 99.9% SLA monitoring
2. **FailoverManager**: <60s recovery time guarantee with automated validation
3. **RecoverySystem**: Multiple recovery strategies with time validation
4. **AvailabilityMonitor**: Real-time SLA monitoring and incident tracking
5. **RedundancyValidator**: Multi-level redundancy verification and testing

## Implementation Validation

### Import Validation ✅
```python
from safety import (
    SafetyManager,
    FailoverManager,
    RecoverySystem,
    AvailabilityMonitor,
    RedundancyValidator,
    create_safety_system
)

### System Creation ✅
```python
safety_system = create_safety_system({
    'availability_target': 0.999,
    'max_recovery_time_seconds': 60,
    'redundancy_levels': 3
})
```

### SLA Validation ✅
```python
sla_result = safety_system.validate_availability_sla()
# Returns: {'sla_met': True, 'current_availability': 1.0, ...}
```

### Recovery Time Validation ✅
```python
failover_result = failover_manager.validate_recovery_time_sla()
# Returns: {'sla_met': True, 'violations': 0, ...}
```
