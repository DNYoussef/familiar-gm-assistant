# Hybrid RAG Architecture Research

## GraphRAG vs Vector RAG Overview

### Traditional Vector RAG Limitations
- Struggles with complex queries requiring aggregation
- Limited multi-hop reasoning capabilities
- Semantic similarity focus misses structural relationships
- Poor performance on "What are the top themes?" type queries

### GraphRAG Advantages
- **Structured Relationships**: Encodes semantic relationships between entities
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Navigate complex entity relationships
- **Hierarchical Understanding**: Community detection and summarization
- **Complex Query Support**: Aggregation across entire dataset

### Hybrid Approach Benefits
- **VectorRAG**: Broad similarity-based retrieval
- **GraphRAG**: Structured relationship-rich contextual data
- **Combined Power**: More accurate answers with richer context

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Vector-based Retrieval
- Vectorize natural language prompts
- Find similar vectors corresponding to graph entities
- Fast semantic similarity matching
- Good for simple rule lookups

### 2. Prompt-to-Query Retrieval
- LLM generates SPARQL/Cypher queries
- Execute against knowledge graph
- Use results to augment prompts
- Better for complex rule interactions

### 3. Hybrid Approaches
- Combine vector and graph approaches
- Vector search for broad context
- Graph traversal for specific relationships
- Weighted combination of results

## Pathfinder 2e Knowledge Graph Design

### Entity Types
- **Rules**: Core mechanics, conditions, actions
- **Creatures**: Monsters, NPCs, stat blocks
- **Items**: Equipment, magic items, weapons
- **Spells**: Spells, rituals, magical effects
- **Classes**: Class features, abilities, archetypes
- **Concepts**: Game concepts, conditions, keywords

### Relationship Types
- **prerequisite**: Feat/ability prerequisites
- **modifies**: Rule modifications and exceptions
- **contains**: Spell lists, equipment sets
- **interacts_with**: Rule interactions
- **similar_to**: Semantic similarity
- **part_of**: Hierarchical relationships

### Graph Structure Example
```
Spell [Fireball] --cast_by--> Class [Wizard]
Spell [Fireball] --deals--> Damage [Fire]
Damage [Fire] --resisted_by--> Resistance [Fire]
Creature [Red Dragon] --has--> Resistance [Fire]
```
