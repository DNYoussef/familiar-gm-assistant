# JWT Authentication System Specification

> **Usage**: Copy this specification to your project's `SPEC.md` to implement JWT authentication  
> **Complexity**: Medium (multi-file, cross-cutting changes)  
> **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours with SPEK-AUGMENT workflow

## Problem Statement

The application currently lacks secure user authentication. Users cannot securely log in, and there's no mechanism to protect sensitive routes or maintain user sessions. This creates security vulnerabilities and prevents implementation of user-specific features.

**Why This Matters**:
- Security compliance requirements
- User data protection
- Feature access control
- Audit trail requirements

## Goals

- [ ] **Goal 1**: Implement JWT token-based authentication with secure generation and validation
- [ ] **Goal 2**: Create middleware system for protecting routes and API endpoints
- [ ] **Goal 3**: Add token refresh mechanism to maintain seamless user experience
- [ ] **Goal 4**: Ensure secure token storage and transmission practices
- [ ] **Goal 5**: Achieve 100% test coverage on all authentication functionality

## Non-Goals

- OAuth integration with third-party providers (future iteration)
- Multi-factor authentication (separate feature)
- Password reset functionality (separate feature)  
- User registration flow (assumes existing user management)
- Role-based permissions (RBAC will be added later)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **AC1**: JWT tokens generated with configurable expiry (default 24h)
- [ ] **AC2**: Token validation middleware protects designated routes
- [ ] **AC3**: Invalid/expired tokens return appropriate 401 responses
- [ ] **AC4**: Token refresh endpoint extends session without re-login
- [ ] **AC5**: All authentication endpoints return consistent error formats

### Security Requirements
- [ ] **AC6**: JWT secrets stored in environment variables only
- [ ] **AC7**: Tokens transmitted via secure Authorization header
- [ ] **AC8**: No sensitive data stored in JWT payload
- [ ] **AC9**: Token expiry enforced consistently across all endpoints
- [ ] **AC10**: Refresh tokens have longer expiry (7 days) but single-use

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] **AC11**: 100% test coverage on authentication logic
- [ ] **AC12**: Integration tests cover complete auth flows
- [ ] **AC13**: Security scan passes with zero high/critical findings
- [ ] **AC14**: TypeScript definitions for all auth interfaces
- [ ] **AC15**: Error handling includes proper logging for security events

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **AC16**: Token validation adds <5ms overhead to requests
- [ ] **AC17**: Token generation completes within 100ms
- [ ] **AC18**: Middleware supports concurrent request processing
