# Phase 2 Configuration Test Environment

## Purpose
Complete analyzer system duplicate for testing Phase 2 configuration changes.

## Status: ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL - Archive Only

## Contents
- **115+ Python files**: Full analyzer system copy
- **Configuration files**: `config/analysis_config.yaml`, `detector_config.yaml`, `enterprise_config.yaml`
- **Test outputs**: Various analysis results and test files
- **Complete module structure**: Full analyzer/ directory replica

## Experimental Nature
This is a **TESTING ENVIRONMENT** containing:
1. Full system duplication for configuration experiments
2. Modified versions of production modules
3. Experimental configuration patterns
4. Test outputs and validation files

## Why Archive Only
❌ **Not Production Ready**:
- Contains duplicate implementations
- Experimental configurations not validated
- Testing artifacts mixed with code
- No clear upgrade path to production
- Creates maintenance burden

✅ **Historical Value**:
- Documents Phase 2 configuration approach
- Contains experimental patterns for future reference
- Shows evolution of configuration system
- Useful for understanding system architecture

## Contains Useful Patterns
- Enhanced configuration management
- Enterprise feature flags
- Performance monitoring integration
- Cross-phase learning patterns

## Archive Strategy
Move to `.sandboxes/archive/phase2-config-test/` for historical reference.
Extract any proven patterns for integration into main codebase separately.

## Production Impact: NONE
This environment should remain isolated from production systems.
