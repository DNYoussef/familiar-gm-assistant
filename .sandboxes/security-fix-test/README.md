# Security Fix Test Sandbox

## Purpose
Testing improved security scanning to distinguish real vulnerabilities from false positives.

## Status: ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL - Extract Patterns Only

## Contents
- `improved_security_scan.py` - Enhanced security scanner with false positive detection
- `proper_security_fix.py` - Security fix implementations
- `test_security_validation.py` - Security validation tests

## Key Innovation
**False Positive Detection**: Distinguishes PyTorch `.eval()` calls from dangerous `eval()` usage.

## Useful Patterns to Extract
1. **AST-based Security Analysis**: More accurate than regex patterns
2. **Context-Aware Detection**: Understands PyTorch vs dangerous eval usage
3. **Severity Classification**: CRITICAL vs medium security issues
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Clear vulnerability categorization

## Why Not Full Migration
- Experimental implementations
- Not integrated with main security scanning
- Testing code mixed with implementation
- Needs integration with existing security framework

## Extraction Strategy
**Integrate patterns into**:
- `analyzer/enterprise/security/` modules
- Main security scanning workflows
- CI/CD security validation

## Archive Experimental Parts
Move experimental implementations to archive while extracting proven patterns.

## Production Value: MEDIUM
Contains valuable security scanning improvements that should be integrated properly.
