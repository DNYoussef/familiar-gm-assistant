# God Object Refactor Sandbox

## Purpose
Experimental refactoring of god objects into single-responsibility classes.

## Status: ✅ STABLE - Ready for Migration

## Contents
- `refactored_analyzer.py` - Unified analyzer broken into 6 focused classes
- `refactored_audit_manager.py` - DFARS audit manager refactored into 6 components
- `test_audit_refactor.py` - Tests for audit manager refactoring
- `test_refactor.py` - Tests for analyzer refactoring

## Key Innovations
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has <15 methods, focused purpose
2. **Dependency Injection**: Clear component separation
3. **MECE Compliance**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive design
4. **Maintainability**: Reduced from 872+ lines to modular components

## Migration Strategy
**Target Files**: Apply patterns to main god objects:
- `analyzer/unified_analyzer.py` (2,640 LOC) → Break into components
- `analyzer/core.py` (1,108 LOC) → Apply component pattern
- `analyzer/unified_memory_model.py` (1,048 LOC) → Modularize

## Refactoring Patterns Proven
1. **Configuration Manager**: Handle all config logic
2. **Cache Manager**: Isolated caching responsibility  
3. **Detector Manager**: Manage detector instances
4. **File Processor**: Handle file operations
5. **Result Aggregator**: Aggregate analysis results
6. **Main Orchestrator**: Coordinate components

## Test Results
- ✅ All refactored components pass unit tests
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Reduces complexity significantly
- ✅ Improves testability and maintainability

## Production Readiness: HIGH
Ready for immediate application to main codebase god objects.
