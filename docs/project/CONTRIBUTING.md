- Maintain NASA POT10 quality standards
- Respect classified information boundaries
- Use secure development practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- Git with signed commits
- Security clearance (for classified contributions)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run security validation: `python scripts/validation/comprehensive_defense_validation.py`
4. Verify 100% certification: Check validation results

## Development Process

### 1. Issue Creation
- Use issue templates for security, features, or bugs
- Include DFARS compliance impact assessment
- Reference relevant NASA POT10 requirements

### 2. Branch Creation
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/dfars-enhancement`
- Prefix with security level if applicable
- Follow Git flow conventions

### 3. Development Guidelines
- Follow S-R-P-E-K methodology
- Implement theater detection checks
- Maintain 95%+ quality gates
- Use concurrent execution patterns

### 4. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests for all components
- Security penetration testing
- NASA POT10 compliance validation

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Update API documentation
- Include security considerations
- Add NASA POT10 compliance notes
- Update troubleshooting guides

## Security Requirements

### Classification Levels
- **Unclassified**: Public repository content
- **FOUO**: For Official Use Only content
- **Classified**: Separate secure channels required

### Security Checks
