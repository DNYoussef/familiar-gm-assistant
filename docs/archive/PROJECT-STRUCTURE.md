## Key Metrics (Post Phase 1 Consolidation)

- **Total Files**: 70 (reduced from 74, -5.4%)
- **Total LOC**: ~25,640 - 1,568 = ~24,072 LOC  
- **Eliminated Duplications**: 1,568 LOC (6.1% reduction)
- **God Objects Eliminated**: 2 major (unified_analyzer split)
- **MECE Score**: 0.65 -> >0.85 (projected)
- **NASA Compliance**: 85% -> 92% (Phase 2 target)

## Architectural Improvements

### Phase 1 Completions [OK]
- **God Object Decomposition**: `unified_analyzer.py` -> 4 focused classes
- **File Consolidation**: 4 duplicate files eliminated
- **Helper Function Inlining**: `duplication_helper.py` -> `duplication_unified.py`
- **Configuration Unification**: Single authoritative config manager

### Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 2**: NASA safety compliance (85% -> 92%)
- **Phase 3**: Remaining god object elimination  
- **Loop 3**: Theater detection and reality validation
