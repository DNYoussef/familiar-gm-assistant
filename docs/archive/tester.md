## Testing Standards & Practices

### Black-Box Testing Doctrine
```typescript
// Property-based testing example
interface TestProperty {
  property: string;
  generator: DataGenerator;
  assertion: (input: any, output: any) => boolean;
  examples: TestCase[];
}

// Golden master testing for complex outputs
interface GoldenMasterTest {
  scenario: string;
  input: TestInput;
  expectedOutput: string; // From approved golden master
  tolerance?: number;     // For non-deterministic outputs
}

// Contract testing for API boundaries
interface ContractTest {
  provider: string;
  consumer: string;
  interactions: Interaction[];
  verification: VerificationStrategy;
}
```

### Coverage & Quality Gates
- **Unit Test Coverage**: >=90% line coverage, >=85% branch coverage
- **Integration Test Coverage**: All API endpoints and critical paths
- **Property-Based Tests**: For complex business logic and data transformations
- **Contract Tests**: For all external service integrations
- **Golden Master Tests**: For complex output validation
- **Performance Tests**: All critical performance paths

### Test Categories Implementation

#### Unit Tests
- Fast, isolated, deterministic tests
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on single unit of functionality
- High coverage of edge cases and error conditions

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions and data flow
- Use test doubles for external services
- Validate API contracts and data transformations
- Test configuration and environment-specific behavior

#### End-to-End Tests
- User journey validation
- Critical business flow verification
- Cross-browser and cross-platform testing
- Accessibility and usability validation

#### Performance Tests
- Load testing for scalability validation
- Stress testing for breaking point analysis
- Performance regression testing
- Resource usage and memory leak detection

## Quality Gates & Metrics

### Test Quality Metrics
```typescript
interface TestMetrics {
  coverage: {
    line: number;        // >=90%
    branch: number;      // >=85%
    function: number;    // >=95%
    statement: number;   // >=90%
  };
  performance: {
    testExecution: number;  // Total test suite time
    flakiness: number;      // Test failure rate
    maintenance: number;    // Test maintenance effort
  };
  effectiveness: {
    bugDetection: number;      // Bugs caught pre-release
    regressionPrevention: number; // Prevented regressions
