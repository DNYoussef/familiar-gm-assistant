# SPEK Enhanced Development Platform - Project Specification

## Problem Statement
Current code analysis tools lack comprehensive connascence detection, defense industry compliance standards, and integration capabilities needed for enterprise-grade software development. Existing solutions provide surface-level analysis without deep architectural insight or NASA POT10 compliance required for critical systems.

## Goals
- [ ] Goal 1: Implement comprehensive connascence analysis with 9 specialized detectors (CoM, CoP, CoA, CoT, CoV, CoE, CoI, CoN, CoC)
- [ ] Goal 2: Achieve ≥90% NASA POT10 compliance for defense industry deployment readiness
- [ ] Goal 3: Provide modular, extensible analyzer architecture supporting parallel processing
- [ ] Goal 4: Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated quality gate enforcement
- [ ] Goal 5: Generate industry-standard SARIF reports for security and quality findings

## Non-Goals
- Multi-AI agent coordination systems (focus on code analysis)
- Real-time chat interfaces or conversational AI
- General-purpose development environment replacement
- Non-Python language primary support (Python analyzer focus)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1: All 9 connascence detectors operational with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Criterion 2: NASA POT10 compliance validation achieves ≥90% score on test codebases
- [ ] Criterion 3: SARIF output format compatible with GitHub Security tab
- [ ] Criterion 4: Parallel analysis processing reduces analysis time by ≥30% on large codebases
- [ ] Criterion 5: Quality gate integration blocks PRs failing defined thresholds
- [ ] Criterion 6: DFARS 252.204-7012 compliance framework operational

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| AST parsing performance bottlenecks | High | Medium | Implement caching and incremental analysis |
| NASA compliance requirements change | Medium | Low | Modular policy engine for requirement updates |
| GitHub API rate limiting | Medium | Medium | Implement request batching and retry logic |
| False positive rates in detectors | High | Medium | Extensive test suite with golden master tests |
| Memory usage on large codebases | Medium | Medium | Streaming analysis and memory monitoring |

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Core functionality validation
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
python -m analyzer.core --path . --policy nasa_jpl_pot10 --format json

# Quality gates validation
python -m flake8 analyzer/ --max-line-length=120
python -m mypy analyzer/ --ignore-missing-imports
python -m bandit -r analyzer/ -f json

# Performance validation
python test_modules.py
python -m analyzer.optimization.performance_benchmark
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Python ≥3.8 with AST parsing capabilities
- [ ] GitHub API access for Actions integration
- [ ] SARIF libraries for report generation
- [ ] Semgrep for security rule integration
- [ ] Pytest framework for comprehensive testing

## Current Implementation Status
- **Core Analyzer**: ✅ Operational (70 files, ~25K LOC)
- **Connascence Detectors**: ✅ 9 detectors implemented
- **NASA POT10 Engine**: ✅ Basic compliance framework
- **SARIF Integration**: ✅ Report generation working
- **GitHub Actions**: ⚠️ Basic workflows, needs enhancement
- **Performance Optimization**: ⚠️ Caching implemented, needs tuning
- **Documentation**: ⚠️ Needs alignment with actual capabilities

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Documentation cleanup and test suite stabilization
- **Week 2**: NASA compliance validation and threshold tuning
- **Week 3**: Performance optimization and GitHub integration enhancement
- **Week 4**: Final validation and production readiness assessment
