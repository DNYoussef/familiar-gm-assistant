# Swarm Agent Deployment Protocol - Quality Gates Analysis

## Swarm Configuration
- **Topology**: Mesh Network (8-agent peer-to-peer)
- **Session ID**: `swarm-quality-gates-analysis`
- **Coordinator**: System-Architect 
- **Communication**: Distributed consensus with mesh connectivity

## Agent Deployment Sequence

### Phase 1: Core Analysis Agents (High Priority)
Deploy in parallel for immediate analysis coverage:

1. **researcher-gemini-001** -> Large-context codebase analysis
2. **code-analyzer-002** -> 70-file analyzer structure deep dive
3. **fresh-eyes-gemini-004** -> Pre-mortem risk analysis  
4. **architecture-005** -> System design assessment
5. **security-manager-007** -> NASA POT10 compliance auditing

### Phase 2: Support & Coordination Agents (Medium Priority)
Deploy after core agents establish initial findings:

6. **performance-benchmarker-003** -> Baseline metrics establishment
7. **specification-006** -> Quality gate compliance analysis
8. **memory-coordinator-008** -> Cross-session pattern learning

## Agent Coordination Protocols

### Mesh Network Communication
- **All-to-All Connectivity**: Every agent can directly communicate with every other agent
- **Distributed Decision Making**: No single point of failure
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Voting-based conflict resolution
- **Load Distribution**: Capability-based task allocation

### Memory Namespaces
```
quality-analysis/
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] research/     -> researcher-gemini findings
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] code/         -> code-analyzer structural analysis
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] performance/  -> benchmarker baseline metrics
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] risks/        -> fresh-eyes-gemini risk assessment
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] architecture/ -> architecture design assessment
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] specs/        -> specification compliance analysis
[U+251C][U+2500][U+2500] security/     -> security-manager audit results
[U+2514][U+2500][U+2500] memory/       -> memory-coordinator learning patterns
```

### Coordination Checkpoints
1. **Initial Survey** (0-5 mins): Each agent establishes baseline understanding
2. **Findings Synthesis** (5-15 mins): Cross-agent knowledge sharing
3. **Risk Assessment** (15-25 mins): Consolidated risk analysis
4. **Remediation Planning** (25-35 mins): Coordinated solution development
5. **Implementation Strategy** (35-45 mins): Final deployment protocol

## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels
- **Broadcast**: System-wide announcements and status updates
- **Direct Peer**: Agent-to-agent specialized communication
- **Memory Shared**: Persistent findings storage and retrieval
- **Persistent Memory**: Cross-session learning coordination

### Backup Communication
- **Architecture-005** as backup coordinator
- **Researcher-gemini-001** as secondary backup
- Failover protocols for network partitions

## Resource Allocation

### High-Priority Agents (researcher-gemini, architecture, security-manager, fresh-eyes-gemini)
- Maximum context window allocation
- High processing priority
- Dedicated memory allocation
- Full system access rights

### Medium-Priority Agents (performance-benchmarker, specification, memory-coordinator)
- Standard resource allocation
- Shared processing priority
- Collaborative memory access
- Specialized tool access

### Load Balancing Strategy
- **Capability-Based**: Route tasks to most qualified agents
- **Dynamic Reallocation**: Adjust based on workload and discoveries
- **Redundant Analysis**: Critical findings verified by multiple agents
- **Consensus Validation**: Important decisions require agent agreement

## Failure Tolerance

### Network Resilience
- Mesh topology eliminates single points of failure
- Agent failures don't break communication paths
- Automatic failover to backup coordinators
- Graceful degradation under load

### Recovery Protocols
- Memory namespace persistence across failures
- Session state recovery mechanisms
- Progressive degradation with agent loss
- Automatic agent respawning if possible
