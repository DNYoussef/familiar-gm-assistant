## DYNAMIC COORDINATION MATRIX

### Topology Selection Logic
```yaml
HIERARCHICAL Mode:
  Trigger: Complex optimization requiring central coordination
  Use Cases: Initial analysis, conflict resolution, resource arbitration
  Metrics: >3 concurrent optimization tasks, resource conflicts detected

MESH Mode:
  Trigger: Independent optimization tasks with cross-validation needs
  Use Cases: Parallel profiling, distributed benchmarking
  Metrics: High parallelizability, fault tolerance required

STAR Mode:
  Trigger: Single optimization focus with result aggregation
  Use Cases: Focused bottleneck resolution, centralized reporting
  Metrics: Single critical path, centralized data flow

HYBRID Mode:
  Trigger: Mixed workload with varying complexity
  Use Cases: Transitional phases, multi-objective optimization
  Metrics: Variable task characteristics, optimization exploration
```

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TARGETS

### Critical Metrics
- **Unified Visitor Efficiency**: Target 85-90% AST traversal reduction
- **Detector Pool Performance**: Minimize thread contention, optimize resource usage
- **Result Aggregation Speed**: Identify and eliminate bottlenecks
- **Cache Intelligence**: Optimize warming strategies and streaming performance

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **CPU Utilization**: Per-agent resource consumption tracking
- **Memory Usage**: Detector pool allocation optimization
- **I/O Performance**: File system and network bottleneck identification
- **Coordination Overhead**: Inter-agent communication efficiency

## ADAPTIVE PROTOCOLS

### Automatic Topology Switching
1. **Performance Baseline Collection** (30s intervals)
2. **Bottleneck Pattern Recognition** (ML-driven analysis)
3. **Topology Effectiveness Prediction** (historical data)
4. **Seamless Transition Execution** (< 5s switchover)
5. **Post-Switch Validation** (improvement verification)

### Self-Healing Mechanisms
- **Agent Health Monitoring**: Automatic failure detection
- **Load Rebalancing**: Dynamic work redistribution
- **Resource Scaling**: Automatic capacity adjustment
- **Performance Recovery**: Rollback to stable configurations

## MCP INTEGRATION POINTS
