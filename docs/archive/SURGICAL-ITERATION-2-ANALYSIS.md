## SURGICAL TARGET IDENTIFICATION

**HIGHEST IMPACT TARGET**: NASA POT10 Compliance Fix (2s failure)

**Rationale**:
- Still failing after pip fix = additional root cause
- Foundational to entire NASA compliance cascade
- 2s failure = quick setup/configuration issue
- Healing this could cascade-fix 8+ NASA-related workflows

**Next Investigation**: Examine NASA POT10 Compliance Fix workflow logs to identify what's still causing 2s failure beyond the pip install command.

## SURGICAL APPROACH #2

1. **ROOT CAUSE**: Investigate NASA POT10 Compliance Fix 2s failure specifically
2. **HYPOTHESIS**: Additional configuration/setup issue beyond pip install
3. **LOCAL TEST**: Reproduce the NASA workflow setup locally
4. **SURGICAL FIX**: One specific change to resolve 2s failure
5. **CASCADE VALIDATION**: Measure impact on NASA cascade workflows

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Target Impact**:
- NASA POT10 Compliance Fix: 2s → PASS
- NASA POT10 Compliance Gates: 2s → PASS
- NASA Rule Validations: 15-29s → IMPROVED/PASS
- NASA Consolidation: 7s → IMPROVED/PASS
- **Expected**: 6-8 workflow cascade healing

**Measurement**: 20 failures → 12-14 failures (6-8 workflow improvement)

**NEXT ACTION**: Examine specific failure logs from NASA POT10 Compliance Fix to identify the remaining root cause after our pip install fix.
