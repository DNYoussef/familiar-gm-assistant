## Planning Standards & Methodologies

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
```typescript
interface WorkPackage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'specification' | 'design' | 'implementation' | 'testing' | 'review';
  estimatedEffort: Duration;
  dependencies: string[];
  assignedAgents: AgentType[];
  qualityGates: QualityGate[];
  deliverables: Deliverable[];
  riskFactors: RiskAssessment[];
}

interface ExecutionPlan {
  workPackages: WorkPackage[];
  timeline: ProjectTimeline;
  resourceAllocation: ResourcePlan;
  riskMitigation: RiskPlan;
  qualityStrategy: QualityPlan;
  communicationPlan: CommunicationStrategy;
}
```

### Resource Allocation Matrix
```typescript
interface ResourceAllocation {
  agent: AgentType;
  capacity: number;        // Available hours/effort
  skills: Skill[];         // Agent capabilities
  assignments: Assignment[]; // Current work packages
  utilization: number;     // Capacity utilization %
  availability: TimeSlot[]; // Available time windows
}

interface SkillMatrix {
  [agentType: string]: {
    primary: Skill[];      // Core competencies
    secondary: Skill[];    // Supporting capabilities
    learning: Skill[];     // Development areas
  };
}
```

### Quality Gate Planning
- **Specification Gates**: Requirements clarity and completeness
- **Design Gates**: Architecture validation and feasibility
- **Implementation Gates**: Code quality and test coverage
- **Integration Gates**: System integration and compatibility
- **Deployment Gates**: Production readiness and performance

## Risk Management Framework

### Risk Assessment Categories
```typescript
interface RiskAssessment {
  category: 'technical' | 'resource' | 'timeline' | 'quality' | 'external';
  description: string;
  probability: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  severity: number;        // probability * impact
  mitigation: MitigationStrategy;
  owner: AgentType;
  timeline: string;
}

interface MitigationStrategy {
  preventive: Action[];    // Prevent risk occurrence
  reactive: Action[];      // Respond if risk occurs
  contingency: Plan[];     // Fallback plans
  monitoring: Metric[];    // Early warning indicators
}
```

### Common Risk Patterns
- **Technical Debt**: Impact on velocity and quality
- **Dependency Bottlenecks**: External service delays
- **Resource Constraints**: Team capacity limitations
- **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled requirement changes
- **Integration Complexity**: System interaction challenges

## Collaboration Orchestration

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```json
{
  "coordination_pattern": "parallel_execution",
  "active_workstreams": [
    {
      "stream_id": "frontend_implementation",
      "agents": ["coder", "tester"],
      "dependencies": ["backend_api"],
      "status": "in_progress",
      "completion": 65
    },
    {
      "stream_id": "backend_api",
      "agents": ["coder", "reviewer"],
      "dependencies": [],
      "status": "completed",
      "completion": 100
    }
  ],

    effortVariance: number;      // Planned vs actual effort
    timelineVariance: number;    // Planned vs actual timeline
    scopeCreep: number;          // Scope changes %
  };
  resourceUtilization: {
    teamEfficiency: number;      // Productive time %
    bottleneckFrequency: number; // Resource constraint events
    idleTime: number;           // Unused capacity %
  };

    gatePassRate: number;       // Quality gates passed first time
    reworkRequired: number;      // Rework effort %
    customerSatisfaction: number; // Delivery quality score
